# Troubleshooting

## No MAC addresses or vendor info

MAC addresses and vendor information require elevated privileges to read the ARP table.

**Solution:** Run with sudo (or as Administrator on Windows):

```bash
# Linux/macOS
sudo orangutan scan
sudo orangutan serve

# Windows - run Command Prompt as Administrator
orangutan.exe scan
```

## Service won't start

```bash
# Check service status
sudo systemctl status lan-orangutan

# View logs
sudo journalctl -u lan-orangutan -n 50

# Check if binary exists and is executable
ls -la /usr/local/bin/orangutan
```

## Port already in use

```bash
# Check what's using the port
sudo ss -tulnp | grep :291

# Use a different port
orangutan serve --port 8080
```

Or change the port in your config file.

## No devices found

1. **Check nmap is installed:**
   ```bash
   which nmap
   nmap --version
   ```

2. **Test nmap directly:**
   ```bash
   sudo nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24
   ```

3. **Check network detection:**
   ```bash
   orangutan status
   ```

4. **Scan a specific network:**
   ```bash
   sudo orangutan scan 192.168.1.0/24
   ```

## Can't access web UI

1. **Check if server is running:**
   ```bash
   orangutan status
   # or
   curl http://localhost:291/
   ```

2. **Check firewall:**
   ```bash
   # Linux (ufw)
   sudo ufw status
   sudo ufw allow 291/tcp

   # Linux (firewalld)
   sudo firewall-cmd --list-ports
   sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=291/tcp --permanent
   ```

3. **Check if binding to correct address:**
   ```bash
   # Allow external access
   orangutan serve --bind 0.0.0.0
   ```

   This is the default. The first visit asks you to create a password, so the
   dashboard is not left open on your network.

## Tailscale not detected

1. **Check Tailscale is installed and running:**
   ```bash
   tailscale status
   ```

2. **On macOS, ensure CLI is available:**
   ```bash
   # If using Tailscale app from App Store
   /Applications/Tailscale.app/Contents/MacOS/Tailscale status
   ```

3. **Running in Docker? Tailscale will read as "Not Installed."** The container
   has its own filesystem and cannot see the host's Tailscale, so the status and
   the connect/disconnect controls are unavailable there even when the host is on
   your tailnet. Run the binary directly on the host to use Tailscale with LAN
   Orangutan.

## Connect or disconnect button does nothing

The connect and disconnect buttons run the Tailscale CLI on the machine hosting
LAN Orangutan, so they need that CLI reachable, the same requirement as detection
above.

1. **Confirm the CLI works from that machine:** `tailscale status`. If it is not
   found, the buttons cannot work either.
2. **Connecting shows a sign-in link instead of connecting.** That is expected
   when the machine is not signed in yet. Open the link, finish signing in, then
   refresh the page.
3. **The disconnect warning is deliberate.** If you reach the dashboard over
   Tailscale, disconnecting cuts your own connection and you will need local
   access to bring it back.

## Rate limiting errors

If you see "Rate limited" errors when scanning, wait 30 seconds between scans. This prevents overloading your network.

## Data not persisting

Check that the data directory exists and is writable:

```bash
# Linux
ls -la ~/.local/share/lan-orangutan/
# or as root
ls -la /var/lib/lan-orangutan/

# macOS
ls -la ~/Library/Application\ Support/lan-orangutan/
```

## View debug output

```bash
# Run with verbose output
orangutan scan -v

# Check version
orangutan version
```

## Still having issues?

1. Check the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/spoutin/LAN-Orangutan/issues)
2. Open a new issue with:
   - Your OS and version
   - Output of `orangutan version`
   - Output of `orangutan status`
   - Steps to reproduce the problem
