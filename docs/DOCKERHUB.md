## ⚠️ Linux only

This image needs **host networking**, which means it only works on Linux.

Docker Desktop on macOS and Windows runs Linux inside a virtual machine. `network_mode: host` attaches to that VM, not your computer: the dashboard is unreachable, and the VM's gateway answers probes for addresses that do not exist, so a scan *looks* successful while reporting devices that were never there. No setting fixes this.

On macOS and Windows, [download the binary](https://github.com/spoutin/LAN-Orangutan/releases) and run it directly instead. It is a single file and takes one command.

LAN Orangutan detects this situation itself and warns at startup and on the dashboard, so results are never silently wrong.

| How you run it | Finds devices | MAC + manufacturer |
|---|---|---|
| **Docker on Linux, host networking** | **Yes** | **Yes** |
| Docker on Linux, bridge networking | No | No |
| Docker on macOS or Windows | No | No |

---

## Quick start

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name lan-orangutan \
  --network host \
  --cap-add NET_RAW --cap-add NET_ADMIN --cap-add NET_BIND_SERVICE \
  -v $(pwd)/data:/var/lib/lan-orangutan \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  291group/lan-orangutan:latest
```

Then open `http://<that-machine>:291` and create a password. Nothing is reachable until you do. There is no default password and none is generated for you.

### docker compose

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/291-Group/LAN-Orangutan/main/docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d
```

The published compose file pulls from GHCR. To use Docker Hub instead, change the `image:` line to `291group/lan-orangutan:latest`.

```yaml
services:
  lan-orangutan:
    image: 291group/lan-orangutan:latest
    container_name: lan-orangutan
    restart: unless-stopped
    network_mode: host
    cap_add:
      - NET_RAW
      - NET_ADMIN
      - NET_BIND_SERVICE
    environment:
      - ORANGUTAN_PORT=291
      - TZ=UTC
    volumes:
      - ./data:/var/lib/lan-orangutan
```

## Tags & architectures

| Tag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `latest` | Most recent release |
| `3.2.1`, `3.1.4`, … | A specific release |

Built for **linux/amd64** and **linux/arm64** (multi-arch manifest, so Raspberry Pi 4/5 and other arm64 boards pull the right image automatically).

Also published to GHCR as `ghcr.io/291-group/lan-orangutan`. Identical images; pull from whichever you prefer.

---

## Configuration

Every setting can be supplied through the environment, which overrides the config file at `/etc/lan-orangutan/config.ini`.

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ORANGUTAN_PORT` | Port to listen on (default `291`) |
| `ORANGUTAN_BIND_ADDRESS` | Address to bind to |
| `ORANGUTAN_PASSWORD` | Set the password up front instead of on first open |
| `ORANGUTAN_PASSWORD_FILE` | Read the password from a file, e.g. a Docker secret (wins over the above) |
| `ORANGUTAN_SESSION_HOURS` | How long a login lasts (default one week) |
| `ORANGUTAN_ALLOW_INSECURE` | Skip password protection entirely |
| `ORANGUTAN_DATA_DIR` | Where devices and settings are stored (preset to `/var/lib/lan-orangutan`) |
| `ORANGUTAN_SCAN_INTERVAL` | Auto-scan interval in seconds |
| `ORANGUTAN_NETWORKS` | Extra networks to scan, comma separated |
| `ORANGUTAN_THEME` | `light`, `dark` or `auto` |
| `TZ` | Container timezone |

**Volume:** `/var/lib/lan-orangutan`: your device list, labels, notes and password hash. Without it, everything is lost when the container is recreated.

**Port:** `291` (under host networking this is taken directly from the host).

**Scanning networks that aren't detected.** LAN Orangutan finds networks by reading the machine's own interfaces, so a routed subnet or VLAN is never offered automatically. List them explicitly with `ORANGUTAN_NETWORKS=192.168.10.0/24,10.0.5.0/24`. Results for a routed network have no MAC addresses or manufacturer names, since those come from ARP and only work on the same segment.

## Features

- Auto-discovers devices with **nmap** (bundled in the image)
- Password protected, you set the password the first time you open it
- Label, group and add notes to devices
- Multi-network support
- **Tailscale integration**: connect, disconnect, and discover tailnet peers from inside the app
- Live scan progress you can cancel, with a time estimate
- Modern web dashboard, light/dark mode, keyboard shortcuts
- Full CLI with JSON output
- Export to CSV/JSON

### Tailscale

If Tailscale is connected, its online peers are added to your device list alongside the machines on your local networks. Peers are read from Tailscale directly rather than scanned, because Tailscale gives every node its own single-address network, so there is no range to sweep. Peers show their Tailscale hostname and OS; they have no MAC address, so no vendor is looked up. Controlling Tailscale from the dashboard requires the Tailscale CLI on the host.

---

## Security

- **First run** presents a "create a password" screen. Until you finish it, every page and every API endpoint is refused. The password is stored as a bcrypt hash in a file readable only by its owner, separately from your config.
- **Sign-in** lasts a week by default. Five wrong guesses lock that address out for fifteen minutes.
- **Set the password in advance** with `ORANGUTAN_PASSWORD`, or keep it out of the environment with `ORANGUTAN_PASSWORD_FILE=/run/secrets/orangutan`.
- **Turn auth off** with `ORANGUTAN_ALLOW_INSECURE=true` only when access control genuinely lives elsewhere, such as a reverse proxy that handles login.
- **No built-in HTTPS.** Put LAN Orangutan behind a reverse proxy, or reach it over Tailscale, if you need the connection encrypted.

### Why the container runs as root

nmap needs raw sockets to read the ARP table, which is what supplies MAC addresses and manufacturer names, and port 291 is privileged. Capabilities granted with `cap_add` land in the permitted set but never become effective for a process that starts as a non-root user, so running unprivileged meant the container could neither bind its port nor identify a single device. This is the same choice the systemd service makes. The container itself remains the isolation boundary.

## Image details

- Base: `alpine:3.24`, statically linked Go binary (`CGO_ENABLED=0`)
- Includes `nmap`, `nmap-scripts`, `ca-certificates`, `tzdata`
- Built-in `HEALTHCHECK` polling a public static asset over `127.0.0.1`, so it reports "is the server up" rather than "is it unlocked"
- Entrypoint `orangutan`, default command `serve`

Run any CLI command by overriding the command:

```bash
docker exec lan-orangutan orangutan list --format json
docker exec lan-orangutan orangutan status
docker exec lan-orangutan orangutan networks
```

## Philosophy

LAN Orangutan isn't trying to be the most powerful scanner out there, and that's the point. There are already excellent, deeply capable tools in this space, and they're the right choice when you need everything they offer. LAN Orangutan is for the other times, when you just want to scan a network now, without the setup and complexity heavier tools bring.
